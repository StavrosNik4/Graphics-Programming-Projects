# Graphics Programming Projects
University Projects for Graphics classes. Implemented with C and OpenGL (GLUT).

## How to run the executables?

Just download the .exe files and the .dll file, put them together in a folder and just run them.

## Computer Graphics Class Projects

This is a collection of 3 projects we made during the semester of the Computer Graphics class. Although they are quite simple they taught us the basics of Graphics Programming.

### Project 1: Fractals - The Basics

Simple Fractals creation and camera movement through the mouse.

### Project 2: Spinning Cube - Basic Transforms

Simple creation of a cube and application of different basic transformations (Rotation, Translation, Scaling).

### Project 3: House with sun - Lighting and Advanced Topics

We created a 3D scene of a house with a sun and also enhanced the scene with lighting techniques. The 3D object of the sun was created through recursive subdivision.

## Modelling - Digital Image Synthesis Class Projects

This is a collection of 2 projects (each with 2 subprojects) we made during the semester of the Modelling - Digital Image Synthesis Class. During that time those projects taught us the math behind the Splines and Surfaces, the physics behind the particles systems and also the basics of animation.

### Project 1.1: Splines

Different kinds of splines in an app.

### Project 1.2: Bicubic Surface

A simple app that creates a wavy bicubic surface.

### Project 2.1: Modular Hierarchical Dog Model

Simple dog model with 3 different animations and an option to reset to the original position. The model consists of 15 different parts and a Left Child Right Simpling Tree implementation is used to handle the transformations.

### Project 2.2: Particles System

Simple fountain like particles system. It produces contiously 1000 particles from a specific point of the "sky" with some initial forces, 
those particles then fall to the field by the force of the gravity and then they bounce until they stay still on the field. You can change the 
color of the particles and also restart the process through keyboard shortcuts.
