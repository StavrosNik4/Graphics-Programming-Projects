## Computer Graphics Class Projects

### Project 1: Fractals - The Basics

### Project 2: Cube - Basic Transforms

### Project 3: House with sun - Lighting and Advanced Topics

## Modelling - Digital Image Synthesis Class Projects

### Project 1.1: Splines

### Project 1.2: Bicubic Surface

### Project 2.1: Modular Hierarchical Dog Model

Simple dog model with 3 different animations and an option to reset to the original position. The model consists of 15 different parts and a Left Child Right Simpling Tree implementation is used to handle the transformations.

### Project 2.2: Particles System

Simple fountain like particles system. It produces contiously 1000 particles from a specific point of the "sky" with some initial forces, 
those particles then fall to the field by the force of the gravity and then they bounce until they stay still on the field. You can change the 
color of the particles and also restart the process through keyboard shortcuts.
